# Epigenetics

In this report I present an analysis of one of the epigenetic marks found in the paper *“Lineage-Specific Genome Architecture Links Enhancers and Non-coding Disease Variants to Target Gene Promoters”* related to H3K4me3. We analyze the difference of the H3K4me3 enrichment in promoters and fragments and the transcription factors involved.

The analysis is in 3 formats, rmd, pdf and html, and includes:

I. Data Managment
    1. Data Download
    2. Filtering promoters-fragments 
    3. Liftover
    4. Normalizing Data
    5. Sorting Data
    6. Computematrix realization
II. Testing Data Normality
    1. Loading data
    2. Shapiro-Wilk’s Method
III. Histone enrichment in promoters and fragments
    1. Enrichment hypothesis test
    2. Wilcox Test
IV. TFs Enriched
    1. Non redundant Jaspar collection
    2. Pattern matching
